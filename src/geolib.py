    Calculate the orthodromic distance between two GPS readings.

    point_a and point_b can be either of the two:
    - tuples in the form (latitude, longitude).
    - dictionaries having X, Y keys (as for example records of the class
      RawLog
    The result is in metres.

    ATTENTION: since latitude is given before longitude, if we are using the
    X and Y representation, then we must pass in (Y, X) and *not* (X, Y)
